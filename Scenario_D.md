**Hi Dennis,**

Thank you for reaching out. We appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to make up for the missed coursework. We understand that life can get busy, and we regret having to withdraw you from the course due to non-compliance with our policy.

Unfortunately, our course policies require consistent engagement, and once a student is withdrawn, we are unable to reinstate them in the current cohort. This ensures that all students stay on track with the structured learning experience.

That said, we still want to support your learning journey by transitioning you to Observer status with the same GitHub account you used to register. This means you can still review the content, practice exercises, and apply the concepts at your own pace.

Here are the details of what being an Observer entails:
* You will get access to the full course material.
* You are not required and will not be able to attend any instructor-led sessions.
* You are not required to submit any assignments and do not have to meet any deadlines.
* You will not have access to the Slack announcement or career-center channels
* You will have access to the session recordings of the most recent cohort through our course learning portal.
* You can no longer attend the Emerging Engineers Summit unless you are a completer of another CodePath course or is actively enrolled and on track to complete a CodePath course in Fall 2025.
* You will not receive the certificate of completion.


Additionally, we encourage you to consider reapplying for a future cohort if your schedule allows. If you’d like, we can also notify you about upcoming opportunities, just let us know!

We truly appreciate your commitment to learning, and we hope you continue honing your technical interview skills. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions.


All the best,

**CodePath Support**
