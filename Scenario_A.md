**Hi John,**

Thank you for reaching out and for your enthusiasm about the program. We appreciate your strong academic background and your eagerness to challenge yourself.

We want to ensure that every student is placed in the track that best supports their growth and success. Our placement decisions are based on pre-work scores, as they reflect technical interview readiness. While the first few topics in the Intermediate and Advanced tracks may be similar, the pacing and depth of instruction differ significantly. To ensure that you receive the best experience possible, we are unable to override the placement decision.

That being said, we encourage you to take full advantage of the Intermediate track, which will still provide a rigorous learning experience. Many students find that mastering core concepts at this level helps them build a strong foundation for success in technical interviews. Additionally, if you are looking for an extra challenge, we recommend engaging deeply with the course material, exploring stretch exercises, and actively participating in discussions.

We truly appreciate your understanding, and we’re excited to have you in the program. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions.

All the best,

**CodePath Support**
