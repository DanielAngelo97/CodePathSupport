**Hi Jane,**

Thank you for reaching out and for the time and effort you put into completing the application process, especially in building the Flix app. We truly appreciate your dedication and enthusiasm for learning.

We understand how disappointing it must be to find out that you are ineligible after investing so much effort. While we would love to welcome all passionate learners into our program, our current courses are restricted to students enrolled in partner universities within the United States due to our sponsorship agreements as a non-profit organization.

That being said, we are always looking for ways to expand our reach. In the past, we have offered programs in Haiti and Taiwan, and we hope to bring our courses to more international students in the future. While we are unable to make exceptions at this time, we encourage you to stay connected with us. If we expand our programs to new regions, we would love to let you know.

Again, we truly appreciate the effort you put into the application process. While you won’t be able to enroll in this program right now, we hope you continue your learning journey. If you’re interested, we’d be happy to share resources that might help you explore technical topics on your own. You can visit[ CodePath Online Resources](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) for more information. 

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, and thank you again for your understanding.


All the best,

**CodePath Support**
