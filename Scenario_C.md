**Hi Anne,**

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in our **Summer Interview Prep course**. We truly admire your dedication to improving your technical interview skills, and we understand how frustrating and challenging the job search process can be.

Unfortunately, the application deadline for this summer’s course passed two weeks ago, and the class is already full with a long waitlist. Since you’re graduating this spring and won’t be eligible for next year’s program, I know this news is disappointing, and I sincerely wish we had more flexibility.

That said, we still want to support you in your interview preparation journey. We’d love to share our [Software Interview Guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view), which contains helpful strategies, practice tips, and guidelines to strengthen your technical interview skills. Additionally, you can explore more learning resources on our [Resources Page](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view).

We also encourage you to sign up for our mailing list so you can stay informed about future programs, virtual events, and other opportunities that may align with your goals: [Join Our Mailing List](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view).

We know how tough this process can be, but we truly believe that with persistence and the right resources, you’ll find the opportunity that’s right for you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if we can help in any other way. Wishing you the best in your job search!


All the best,

**CodePath Support**
